# Changelog

## v1.19 - 2026-07-02

- Removed the separate review-pending `## Invoke With YAML` command block; compiled YAML now carries continuation via `command` and `agent_routing.command`, so terminal handoffs tell users to clear context and paste the compiled YAML directly.

## v1.18 - 2026-06-20

- Changed the review-pending Pattern A handoff to `## Invoke With YAML`; the section now only names the parent skill invocation to use with compiled YAML while `## Next Work` owns the review/compile/paste instructions.

## v1.17 - 2026-06-18

- Product-Path Scope Resolution now disambiguates product paths from git branches ("Product paths are research scopes, not git branches or parallel implementation lanes"), restoring the manifest-contract phrasing the product-path-manifest contract expects.

## v1.16 - 2026-06-18

- Moved the deep interview out of the terminal into the stage-zero **interrogation page** loop (`docs/interrogation-page-convention.md`). Renamed State F to **State G — Stage-Zero Interrogation Loop** (round 1 = assumptions manifest; rounds 2..N = adaptive follow-ups; coverage checkpoint = confidence-gate exit) and added a light **State F** that consumes elicited answers into the preliminary interview handoff. The skill cannot advance to stage one (state E) until the confidence gate passes with ≥1 completed round; each round page must carry ≥1 open input. Terminal questioning survives only as the degraded fallback. Added the `## Interrogation Page` bundle stub (`INTERROGATION-PAGE.md`).

## v1.15 - 2026-06-18

- Review-step terminal handoff renamed `## Recommended Next Command After Compiling YAML` → `## Continue In A Fresh Session`; review pages now instruct compile-YAML-and-paste-into-a-fresh-session, and the fresh session emits the real `## Recommended Next Command`.

## v1.14 - 2026-06-17

- Made the State F deep interview self-contained and gated: added an inline **State F — Deep Interview (run before any handoff)** section enumerating Phases 1–4 (Phase 2 assumptions manifest and Phase 4 coverage checkpoint as terminal gates) and stated explicitly that the preliminary interview handoff may be written only after Phase 4 is confirmed — writing it before completing Phases 2 and 4 is a contract violation. Tightened the state-table row and State F handoff note to point at the new section. Closes a verified incident where a Codex run skipped the entire deep interview (asked zero questions) and wrote the handoff directly by reading the by-reference-only State F spec as "write the file and stop."

## v1.13 - 2026-06-17

- Added self-routing Pattern A continuation metadata (`agent_routing`) to review-gate YAML requirements so fresh sessions can route to the parent orchestrator while preserving parent-owned state resolution and inline framework loading.

## v1.12 - 2026-06-17

- Added a required terminal handoff contract so Pattern A loop stops end with `## Next Work` plus the appropriate parent-owned recommended command section, including explicit synthesis routing after the last framework intermediate is written.

## v1.11 - 2026-06-15

- Narrowed approval-boundary routing language so pending review pages may name `Recommended next command after compiling YAML: $customer-discovery` for same-orchestrator loop continuation, while downstream and cross-skill routing remain blocked until approved synthesis artifacts are written.

## v1.10 - 2026-06-15

- Replaced the remaining concrete `customer-discovery/frameworks/...` placeholder in parent-loop routing guidance with generic path-shaped child framework wording.

## v1.9 - 2026-06-15

- Hardened framework-loop routing so pending framework work continues only through the parent orchestrator with the current research path argument, while path-shaped child framework commands remain prohibited.

## v1.8 - 2026-06-15

- Stage 3 now names a concrete confirmed-page validation: reconcile each displayed gate decision against the final compiled YAML and the written canonical artifact, render any `other`/freeform choice as the read-only decision and drop superseded options, and run the alignment-page post-confirmation self-check before handoff. Closes a verified incident where a `confirmed` page retained an active, stale gate question that contradicted the final compiled YAML.

## v1.7 - 2026-06-15

- Clarified that framework completion returns to the parent Research Session Loop rather than downstream routing. Parent-loop continuation now names the parent `customer-discovery` command and disallows execution-loop or direct framework handoffs before synthesized `icp.md` finalization.

## v1.6 - 2026-06-14

- Migrated the orchestrator to the Research Session Loop (`docs/research-session-loop-convention.md`): replaced the Mode A/B/C/D framing and the `tasks/todo.md` + `$exec` framework-queueing with a self-advancing session ladder (states F/E/C/B/A, YAML-first resolution). Reconciles the previously divergent Codex mirror with the Claude mirror's execution model.
- Added the selected-set run manifest `research/_working/customer-discovery-run.yaml` as chunk state; framework progress is now derived from canonical-intermediate file existence.
- State F (deep interview) now writes a preliminary interview handoff and stops; state E reads the handoff to detect mode, bootstrap candidates, and build the multi-select page.
- One approval gate per framework: the multi-select approval satisfies each framework's Stage-1 scope gate, so the loop runs frameworks inline entering at their research stage (Stage 2).
- Synthesis (state B) is auto-detected when all intermediates exist; on canonical write it archives the run manifest + working packet and updates `.progress.yaml`.
- Routing between frameworks is self-re-invocation of `$customer-discovery`; cross-skill routing only after synthesis.

## v1.5 - 2026-06-13

- Removed direct execution-loop command handoffs from non-exec routing; route through approved YAML, task, or roadmap artifacts instead.


# customer-discovery changelog (codex)

## v1.4 - 2026-06-12

- Clarified staged research review pages must render complete working-packet substance as structured HTML UI, with raw Markdown packet text allowed only as a supplemental source view.

## v1.3 - 2026-06-12

- Standardized active pack and skill install guidance on `npx skillpacks install <pack-or-skill>` instead of agent-native `/pack install` or `$pack install` recommendations.

## v1.2 - 2026-06-11

- Added npm-aware install-route guidance so unavailable-pack fallbacks keep `$pack install` while also offering `npx skillpacks install <pack>` from the project shell.

## v1.1 - 2026-06-10

- Changed report-first research flow to require alignment-page research-scope approval before synthesized findings, candidate rankings, recommendations, working packets, or canonical research writes.

## v1.0 - 2026-06-05

- Renamed skill from `icp` to `customer-discovery` to reflect that the skill performs customer discovery using established frameworks, not just ICP template-filling.
- Refactored from monolithic process to orchestrator pattern with 6 framework subskills: w3-hypothesis (Schwartzfarb), jtbd-needs (Ulwick/Christensen), four-forces (Moesta), five-rings (Revella), seven-dimensions (Lincoln Murphy), pmf-engine (Vohra/Supan).
- Added pre-product vs product-exists mode detection with framework defaults per mode.
- Added candidate bootstrapping step before framework selection.
- Added shortcut modes: `$customer-discovery discovery` and `$customer-discovery validate`.
- Canonical output remains `research/icp.md` with preserved 9+1 section format for downstream compatibility.

## v0.11 - 2026-06-04

- Added Marketplace Side Preflight so ICP reads idea-brief side handoffs, infers sides on direct invocation, validates/refutes marketplace/platform/B2B2C classification during broad research, and covers or explicitly excludes each material side before candidate generation.

## v0.10 - 2026-06-04

- Added the shared Pack Availability Guard to match the Claude mirror and restored version parity.

## v0.9 - 2026-06-02

- Added a staged research workflow so preliminary findings stay in non-canonical `_working` packets until review alignment approval finalizes canonical artifacts.

## v0.8 - 2026-06-02

- Added evidence-aware feedback handling so agents push back on factual misunderstandings while honoring subjective user preferences.

## v0.7 - 2026-05-30

- Added product-path scope resolution.

## v0.5 - 2026-05-27

- Added product-path manifest handling.

## v0.4 - 2026-05-26

- Gate cross-pack routing recommendations on pack availability.

## v0.3 - 2026-05-25

- Added bounded willingness-to-pay signal capture.

## v0.2 - 2026-05-25

- Added research-quality alignment requirements.

## v0.1

- Archived previous skill contract.

## v0.0

- Archived previous skill contract.

## v0.6

- Archived previous skill contract.

## Pack Availability Guard

When recommending a skill from another pack, verify the target pack is installed via `.agents/project.json` `enabled_packs`. If it is not enabled, recommend `npx skillpacks install <pack>` from the project shell. After install, tell Codex users to start a fresh Codex CLI session if the `$` skill list remains stale. Only the currently running skill and skills verified available in the active session or project-local install state are directly recommendable. For unavailable pack skills, recommend `npx skillpacks install <pack-or-skill>`; for unavailable base skills, recommend `npx skillpacks init` before the skill.

# Runway Model — Financial Runway & Unit Economics

Invoke as `$runway-model`.

Simple financial model: burn rate, revenue trajectory, runway in months, and scenario modeling. Takes real numbers, projects forward with optimistic/realistic/pessimistic scenarios. Append-only updates for tracking over time.

## Soft Prerequisites

- Read `research/monetization.md` if it exists — theoretical unit economics and pricing to compare against actuals
- Read `research/metrics.md` if it exists — growth rate targets for projections
- Read `research/cohort-review-*.md` if any exist — real performance data for revenue trajectory
- Read `research/gtm.md` if it exists — channel costs for CAC calculations

## Process

### 0. Product-Path Scope Resolution

Resolve research scope by product path before using code or app structure as a hint:

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` names a non-archived `research/{slug}/` directory or a product-path ID whose `scope_path` points there, use that path. Treat `{slug}` as the product/app name, not the ICP, audience, or segment label.
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` names only `research/_archive/{slug}/` or a manifest entry with `status: archived` or legacy `status: abandoned`, stop and warn that the path is archived; do not write or update scoped outputs there.
3. Read `research/.progress.yaml` when present. Normalize legacy `active_path` to `active_paths` on read and write back `active_paths` on manifest updates. Treat legacy `abandoned` as `archived`; exclude `archived`, `abandoned`, `deferred`, `revisit_candidate`, `promoted`, and any `scope_path` under `research/_archive/` from active target selection.
4. If active product paths exist in the manifest, use those paths. If multiple active paths exist, ask which one to target unless this skill explicitly supports cross-path output.
5. If no active manifest target exists, list non-archived product directories under `research/`, excluding `research/_archive/` and dot directories. Auto-select only when exactly one exists; ask when multiple exist.
6. If no product directories exist, use flat `research/` single-product mode.
7. Detect monorepo/app/package structure only as a secondary hint. Suggest creating a missing `research/{slug}/` product path when code clearly exposes an app, but do not require code or monorepo detection before using `research/{slug}/`.

When product path `{slug}` is active, read and write research under `research/{slug}/`, specs under `specs/{slug}/`, and treat top-level `research/*.md` files as flat-mode documents or cross-path summaries.

### 1. Load Context & Data

**Load research context:** Read all soft prerequisite files.

**Ingest financial data:**
Check `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **File path provided**: Read the file
- **Text provided**: Parse the data directly
- **Empty**: Gather the numbers from the user. If the session is already in Plan mode and there are 2-3 concrete input-source choices, prefer `request_user_input`; otherwise ask in plain text.

**Required inputs** (ask for each that's missing):
- Monthly burn rate (total expenses)
- Current cash/bank balance
- Monthly revenue (if any)
- Revenue growth rate (if applicable)
- Team size and key cost categories

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Detailed cost breakdown (salaries, infrastructure, tools, marketing)
- Customer count and ARPU
- CAC by channel
- Churn rate
- Expected cost changes (new hires, infrastructure scaling)

### 2. Calculate Core Metrics

**Runway calculation:**
- **Gross burn**: Total monthly expenses
- **Net burn**: Expenses minus revenue
- **Runway (months)**: Cash balance ÷ net burn
- **Zero-cash date**: Projected date when cash runs out

**Unit economics (if revenue exists):**
- **MRR / ARR**: Monthly/annual recurring revenue
- **ARPU**: Average revenue per user
- **CAC**: Customer acquisition cost (if channel spend data available)
- **LTV**: Lifetime value (ARPU × average lifespan, or ARPU ÷ monthly churn rate)
- **LTV:CAC ratio**: Is acquisition sustainable?
- **Payback period**: Months to recover CAC
- **Gross margin**: Revenue minus cost of delivery

Compare actuals against theoretical estimates from `research/monetization.md` if it exists.

### 3. Scenario Modeling

Build three scenarios projecting 12 months forward:

**Pessimistic** (what if things go wrong):
- Revenue grows at 50% of current rate (or flat)
- Costs increase 10-20% (unexpected expenses, needed hires)
- Churn increases
- Runway: [months]

**Realistic** (current trajectory continues):
- Revenue grows at current rate
- Costs grow as planned
- Churn stays flat
- Runway: [months]

**Optimistic** (what if things go well):
- Revenue grows at 150-200% of current rate
- Costs stay controlled
- Churn decreases
- Runway: [months]

For each scenario, show monthly projections for cash balance, revenue, and expenses.

### 4. Identify Critical Decisions

Based on the model:
- **Break-even point**: When does revenue cover expenses? (per scenario)
- **Hiring runway**: Can you afford to hire? When?
- **Marketing budget**: How much can you spend on acquisition?
- **Runway triggers**: At what cash balance should you raise, cut costs, or change strategy?
- **Revenue milestones needed**: What MRR is needed to extend runway to [target]?

### 5. Present & Validate

Present to the user. If the session is already in Plan mode and there are 2-3 concrete choices, prefer `request_user_input`; otherwise ask in plain text:
- Core metrics summary
- Three scenarios with runway projections
- Critical decisions and trigger points

Ask:
- "Do these numbers match your records? Any costs or revenue I'm missing?"
- "Are the scenario assumptions realistic? Too conservative or too aggressive?"

Incorporate feedback before proceeding.

### 6. Populate Next Steps

Include 3–5 applicable items with "Pick one:" framing:

- IF runway < 6 months: Prioritize revenue — `$experiment` to validate fastest path to revenue, or cut costs
- IF unit economics unhealthy (LTV:CAC < 3): `$monetization` — Revisit pricing or acquisition strategy
- IF no `research/cohort-review-*.md`: `$cohort-review` — Get real performance data to improve projections
- IF actuals diverge from monetization estimates: `$monetization` — Update strategy with real data
- ALWAYS: `$roadmap` — Ensure build plan accounts for runway constraints

### 7. Write Output

Present final model to user. Ask:
- "Ready to write this? Anything to adjust?"

Only after confirmation, write the output file.

## Task Classification

When this skill produces follow-up work, file it by execution semantics:

- Immediately actionable implementation or documentation work goes in `tasks/todo.md`.
- Human-only external actions tied to automated steps go in `tasks/manual-todo.md` with `_(blocks: Step N.X)_` or `_(after: Step N.X)_`; repo edits, SDK wiring, generated assets, local commands, tests, audits, and authenticated CLI/API work stay in `tasks/todo.md`.
- One-time condition-gated records, baselines, or future measurements go in `tasks/record-todo.md` with source, condition, non-blocking reason, evidence, and promotion rule.
- Cadence-based reviews, playtests, adoption checks, investor updates, retros, or docs-health checks go in `tasks/recurring-todo.md` with cadence, owner/agent, next due, evidence path, and escalation conditions.
- Do not put non-blocking records or recurring obligations in `tasks/todo.md` unless they have been explicitly promoted into current execution work.

## Constraints

- **Real numbers only.** Do not fabricate financial data. If numbers aren't provided, ask for them.
- **Append-only.** Previous snapshots are never deleted or modified. Only add new snapshots at the top.
- **State assumptions.** Every projection must list its assumptions explicitly. Never present projections as predictions.
- **Present before writing.** Never write output files until the model has been presented and validated.
- **Conservative by default.** When estimating, err on the conservative side. Optimistic projections should be labeled clearly.
- **No investment advice.** This is a planning tool, not financial advice. Note this in the output.
- **Privacy-aware.** Financial data is sensitive. Do not log raw financial data to search logs or interview logs.

# Changelog

## v0.12 - 2026-07-06

- Added the shared interrogation-page workflow as a Stage 0 gate before alignment-page scope approval.

## v0.10 - 2026-06-12

- Clarified staged research review pages must render complete working-packet substance as structured HTML UI, with raw Markdown packet text allowed only as a supplemental source view.

## v0.9 - 2026-06-12

- Standardized active pack and skill install guidance on `npx skillpacks install <pack-or-skill>` instead of agent-native `/pack install` or `$pack install` recommendations.

## v0.8 - 2026-06-11

- Added npm-aware install-route guidance so unavailable-pack fallbacks keep `$pack install` while also offering `npx skillpacks install <pack>` from the project shell.

## v0.7 - 2026-06-10

- Changed report-first research flow to require alignment-page research-scope approval before synthesized findings, candidate rankings, recommendations, working packets, or canonical research writes.

## v0.6 - 2026-06-02

- Added a staged research workflow so preliminary findings stay in non-canonical `_working` packets until review alignment approval finalizes canonical artifacts.

## v0.5 - 2026-06-02

- Added evidence-aware feedback handling so agents push back on factual misunderstandings while honoring subjective user preferences.

## v0.4 - 2026-05-30

- Added product-path scope resolution that prefers non-archived `research/{slug}/` paths and active manifest paths before code or monorepo hints.
- Excluded `research/_archive/`, legacy `abandoned`, `archived`, `deferred`, `revisit_candidate`, and `promoted` paths from active target selection while preserving flat `research/*.md` compatibility.

## v0.0

- Added research-quality alignment requirements covering claim/evidence/inference separation, no-context-loss HTML translation, evidence matrices, confidence/assumption registers, source coverage, and research completeness gates.

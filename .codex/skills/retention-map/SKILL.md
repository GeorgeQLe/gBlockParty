## Pack Availability Guard

Before telling the user to run a skill from another project-local pack, check `.agents/project.json.enabled_packs`. If the target pack is not enabled, recommend `npx skillpacks install <pack>` from the project shell, instead of the target skill.

# Retention Map

Invoke as `$retention-map`.

Map why customers return, what predicts churn, and how the product recovers at-risk users.

## Process

### 0. Product-Path Scope Resolution

Resolve research scope by product path before using code or app structure as a hint:

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` names a non-archived `research/{slug}/` directory or a product-path ID whose `scope_path` points there, use that path. Treat `{slug}` as the product/app name, not the ICP, audience, or segment label.
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` names only `research/_archive/{slug}/` or a manifest entry with `status: archived` or legacy `status: abandoned`, stop and warn that the path is archived; do not write or update scoped outputs there.
3. Read `research/.progress.yaml` when present. Normalize legacy `active_path` to `active_paths` on read and write back `active_paths` on manifest updates. Treat legacy `abandoned` as `archived`; exclude `archived`, `abandoned`, `deferred`, `revisit_candidate`, `promoted`, and any `scope_path` under `research/_archive/` from active target selection.
4. If active product paths exist in the manifest, use those paths. If multiple active paths exist, ask which one to target unless this skill explicitly supports cross-path output.
5. If no active manifest target exists, list non-archived product directories under `research/`, excluding `research/_archive/` and dot directories. Auto-select only when exactly one exists; ask when multiple exist.
6. If no product directories exist, use flat `research/` single-product mode.
7. Detect monorepo/app/package structure only as a secondary hint. Suggest creating a missing `research/{slug}/` product path when code clearly exposes an app, but do not require code or monorepo detection before using `research/{slug}/`.

When product path `{slug}` is active, read and write research under `research/{slug}/`, specs under `specs/{slug}/`, and treat top-level `research/*.md` files as flat-mode documents or cross-path summaries.

1. Resolve product-path scope using `research/{slug}/` when applicable.
2. Read `research/.progress.yaml` when present. Normalize `active_path` (singular legacy) to `active_paths` (plural list) when reading; treat legacy `abandoned` as `archived` and exclude archived/deferred/revisit/promoted paths plus `research/_archive/` scopes from active target selection. Scope the retention map to the active product path by default.
3. Require `research/journey-map.md`; if missing, recommend `$journey-map`.
4. Load journey, onboarding, conversion, transaction, metrics, customer feedback, specs, and product evidence when present.
5. Interview and recommend around: repeat-use job, natural frequency, core habit/workflow loop, lifecycle messages, saved state, collaboration, renewal moments, churn triggers, downgrade/cancel paths, winback, support recovery, and leading indicators.
6. Present the retention model and risk assumptions before writing.
7. Write `research/retention-map.md` and `research/retention-map-interview.md` in flat mode, or `research/{slug}/retention-map.md` and `research/{slug}/retention-map-interview.md` when product-path scope is active, after validation.

## Alignment Page

Follow the shared alignment-page convention via the packaged convention resolver; output path is `alignment/retention-map-{topic}.html`.

## Constraints

- Do not force habit-loop language onto naturally infrequent or transactional products; document the natural return trigger instead.
- End with `## Next Steps`, preferring `$expansion-map`, `$lifecycle-metrics`, `$hook-model`, `$customer-feedback`, or `$cohort-review` as context dictates.
